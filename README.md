# Seatbelt

A fork of [Seatbelt by TehRamsus](https://github.com/TehRamsus/Seatbelt) with minor performance enhacements and notifications for LEOs.  
You can use `/seatbelt` or `K` on the keyboard to toggle whilst in a vehicle.  

If you're a fellow dev, I recommend taking a look at `IsLEO()` in [`util.lua`](https://github.com/TFNRP/seatbelt/blob/main/util.lua).
